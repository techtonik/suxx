## Bash

`bash` suxx, because:

    $ cat test.sh
    sh -c "exit 102"
    echo $?
    echo Done.
    $ bash test.sh 
    102
    Done.
    $ echo $?
    0

it doesn't [fail on errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2870992/automatic-exit-from-bash-shell-script-on-error).

## C++

`C++` suxx, because

You can not simply override fields from parent class like you do in Python:

```
class Driver(object):
  name = "Unknown"
  def __init__(self):
    print(self.name)

class SpecificDriver(Driver):
  name = "Specific"
  def __init__(self):
    super(SpecificDriver, self).__init__()

Driver()
SpecificDriver()
```

## GCC

`gcc 4.x` suxx, because:

    $ gcc main.c
    $ ls main*
    main.c

## Mailman

`mailman` 2.x mailing list software suxx, because

 * it doesn't have search button for its archives
 * you can't reply to the thread if you're not already subscribed
 * you can't subscribe only to threads you're interested in
 * if you are not subscribed, there is no guaranteed mail delivery
   because it is not clear if you address will be added to CC

## Python

### Jinja 2

 * Doesn't provide ability to list all template variables
   https://github.com/pallets/jinja/issues/174

### python.org as a community site

 * developers don't care about people who are learning web development
   (https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/pull/912)
 * proprietary owned by PSF (there is no sign that it is open source)
 * code is not reusable because of verbose license with no owner
 * doesn't credit people who contributed to it (everything links to PSF)
 * there is no understanding of ux in development involvement

### Python 3

 * it suxx, because it managed to ship `venv` module with all suxx facts from `virtualenv` chapter below
 * it suxx, because for some reason binary data is now math (integers)
```python
line = b'12345'
if line[0] == b'1':
  print('python 2')
else:
  print('python 3')
```

### stdlib.re

`$` matches before `\n`, but not before `\r\n`. It suxx that docs for `$` [don't mention](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax) that this created problems on Windows stdout processing and files read in text mode (default behaviour, which suxx as well).

### virtualenv

`virtualenv` (python-virtualenv) suxx, because

 * you can't just login and logout from the env, you need to `activate` it
 * you can't just refence sctipt in virtualenv - you need platform-aware conditional to choose `bin/` on Linux and `Scripts\` on Windows


## tar

**tar.gz**, **tar.*** archive formats suxx for extracting  random files. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)#Random_access

## Ubuntu PPA

`Ubuntu PPA` suxx, because

 * you can't just `install inkscape from https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable`.
 * `PPA launchpad pages` like https://launchpad.net/~inkscape.dev/+archive/ubuntu/stable just don't have a straightforward single *visible* command needed to the istall the stuff right away ([launchpad#1458513](https://bugs.launchpad.net/launchpad/+bug/1458513))
